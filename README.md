#Magoo

An image analysis tool for quantifying area and density of
color-thresholded images.  Magoo is designed primarily for
high-resolution images of histological tissue preparations.

Magoo is under active development and is not yet ready for use.  Updates
will be posted here as development progresses.

##Todo

* Occasional X freeze on shutdown
* Other calculations/analyses (?)
* Tab completion for parameters (?)
