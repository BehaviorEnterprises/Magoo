#Magoo

An image analysis tool for quantifying area and density of
color-thresholded images.  Magoo is designed primarily for
high-resolution images of histological tissue preparations.

Magoo is under active development and is not yet ready for use.  Updates
will be posted here as development progresses.

##Todo

* Man page needed
* Tab completion for parameters (?)
* Data file with labels
	- free notes in notes.c (?)
	- highlight current label
	- Log to data file: alpha, area, count, echo, ratio
		- Or better yet, define columns in config file and infer number
		- Or existing data file header?

##Bugs

* Drag+Drop on image window (sometimes?) fails
