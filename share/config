## levels ##
## TYPE: positive integer
## Defines the number of ranges to be highlighted
## Use at least two levels to allow for g-ratio style calculations
levels	2

## alpha ##
## TYPE: 8-bit integer (0 - 255)
## The opacity level of the background image.
## A lower opicty works well with highight colors set to 00nnnnnn
## a 0-value for the highlight color opacity instructs magoo to show
## the original image at full opacity in that highlighted region
alpha		255

## line ##
## TYPE: 32-bit color hex code AARRGGBB
## Color and opacity for the bounding line drawn around selected areas
line		AAFFDD0E

## label ##
## TYPE: 32-bit color hex code AARRGGBB
## Color and opacity foreground + background for normal and current labels
label		EE000000 D0FFFFFF EE000044 D0FFDD44

## columns ##
## TYPE: list of values to be logged
## Command names whose output will be logged to the data file if there
## is a selected label.
## Select from the following:
##   area, count, note, ratio
columns	ratio, note

## rangeNN ##
## TYPE: 2 24-bit color hex codes RRGGBB (alpha values are ignored)
## colorNN ##
## TYPE: 32-bit color hex code
## All points in the original image that fall within the defined range
## will be higlighted with the associated color.  If the alpha value of
## color is 00 then these pixels will instead keep their original color
## but be drawn at full opacity.  This 00 alpha setting is only
## effective at highlighting these regions if the 'alpha' setting above
## is less than 255.
range1	000000	A0A0A0
